## Installation

Ensure installation of all necessary dependencies and packages by running "npm i" command in the terminal.

## Usage

Once installation is complete upon running the command "node app.js" in the command line the app will start up and using your keyboard the user can cycle through all the options. As demonstarted in the walkthrough video below the user can view all employees, roles, and departments. The user can also add new employees, roles, and departments. The user can also update an employees role. The user can also delete an employee, role, or department. As a precaution the functions are set up so that the user cannot accidentally delete a department without deleting the roles first and cannot delete a role without deleting the employees first. The user can also exit the application at any time by selecting the exit option.
